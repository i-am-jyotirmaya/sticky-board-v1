### About

**Sticky Board** is an online live collaborative discussion board (or retrospective board). This board can be used for many other purposes other than those mentioned above.

### How to use

The basic entities of **Sticky Board** are:
Board, Section & Note

**Board** is the most basic and the root entity that holds everything. Atleast one board is required to use the app. Each board has its own URL (or room name) and name. Board can have duplicate names (not room name).

**Section** holds Notes and is used to categorize notes on any basis. A section can be seen as a single column of notes.

**Note** is an editable entity that holds our content. We can add multiple notes to a section. Each Note is unique and no two notes are shared in a board. A Note can have its name which can be edited by user and the action is shared by all users connected to the board.
